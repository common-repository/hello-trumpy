every page.

== Description ==

This is not a plugin, it symbolizes the hopes, failures, celebrations and lamentations of an entire global population.
Our world is forever changed by the 2016 election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States of America.
Whether in a good or bad way, is yet to be seen. But it is a pivotal time in History, regardless. It is my hope that
this plugin will make Wordpress great again!

A Throwback to the ever popular [Hello, Dolly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/) plugin included with every
base Wordpress instillation, this plugin is Hello, Dolly "Trumpified"!

When activated, this plugin will pull a random quote using the amazing [What Does Trump Think](https://whatdoestrumpthink.com/api-docs/index.html)
API, and place it in the upper right hand corner of every page on the Admin Dashboard.

**Now with shortcode support!**
You can now add a shortcode "[hello-trumpy]" to your post/page and a random Trump quote shall appear.
If you'd like to, you can use the "shortcode enabled text" widget plugin, or have a theme developer create a hook in your theme and allow
the shortcode to be placed in your widgets as well!

Features great, inspirational quotes such as:
>"My whole life is about winning. I don't lose often. I almost never lose."

> "I love the poorly educated."

> "I have a great relationship with the blacks."

> "I'd like to use really foul language. I won't do it. I was going to say they're really full of s**t, but I won't say that."
